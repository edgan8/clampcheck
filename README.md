Clamp Type Checker and Interpreter, by Edward Gan
with design adapted from Mark Jones "Typing Haskell in Haskell"

The Main executable accepts input declarations from stdin and prints
out the inferred types and output value on stdout. Note that the
current type checker infers all types and accepts no type annotations.

Please see the examples in the tests/ directory for the concrete
syntax! The prelude.clm file is a good place to start.
